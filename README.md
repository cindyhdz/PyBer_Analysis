# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of the analysis was to identify ride sharing analytics by city type (i.e. urban, suburban and rural)—developing graphs that represent total weekly fares based on city types. The intent of the analysis is to improve ride sharing services and affordability.

-Urban cities had the highest number of drives, rides, and total fares—with the lowest average fares per ride and per driver. 

-In contrast, rural cities had the least number of drives, rides, and total fares—having the highest average fares.

-Suburban cities had more drivers, rides, and total fares than rural city types, but less than suburban. 

 # Summary
## Recommendations
Consider increasing fares per mile in urban cities for trips that are less in distance than the average distance. 
Obtain more demographic data on riders by city type to conduct more in-depth analysis. Demographic data will allow for increase financial analysis and exploring trends based on demographics. 
 Expand dataset for an additional timeline (3 years) to develop increased accuracy of trends.
